# Feedback
Several people tested out this project, and were linked to a user feedback survey in order to see what could be improved. Receiving feedback from people outside your team is highly important, as it provides you with perspectives you might not otherwise see, having been familiarized with the code, and knowing what its boundaries and functions are.
