## What is this project?
The goal for this project was to create a simple turn-based combat system in which the player progresses through an infinite number of stages where they oppose a monster selected at random. The simulation features three statistics: health, attack, and defense, which will affect the damage sent and received during in a battle. The amount of health is set at the beginning of the game, and will decrease every time the unit is attacked. The attack stat defines a range of damage that the unit can deal. The defense stat defines the amount of damage the unit can block. The fight ends when one of the units loses all its health. The player will level up after each fight, increasing their ATK and DEF by 2, and their HP by 15. If the player loses, the simulation resets and the playerâ€™s level returns to one.
